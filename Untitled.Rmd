## Introduction
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.
Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet.

### The code of the map

```{r}


library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%
        addMarkers(lat=-22.8914329, lng=-47.0340267, 
             popup="Francisco' home")
my_map
